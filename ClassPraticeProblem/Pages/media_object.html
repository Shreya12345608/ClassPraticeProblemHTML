          <p>Hamsters are the third most commonly used research animal. Ninety percent of these are Syrian hamsters, 
              the other 10% being primarily Chinese, Armenian, and European hamsters. Most Syrian hamsters are a light
               reddish brown color with a grayish white underside. Other color varieties include cinnamon, cream, albino, 
               and piebald. The longhaired "teddy bear" varieties are popular pets. Several inbred strains are available for biomedical research.</p>
